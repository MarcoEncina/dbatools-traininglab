# Readme

Do you want to know more about DBATools but you don't have examples or samples to test it safely? 
Are you like me, relatively new to SQL but are curious about the power of both tools? 
The objective of this repo is to create and centralize various examples of scenarios where DBATools can be useful, providing those examples and samples.
Since I'm relatively new to SQL, it will be a challange to me, mostly because I'm unaware of most SQL concepts and best practices. 
My idea is to take some notes along with the examples that are being creating, helping me and the others :)

# As always, any contribution is welcome! 

Please keep in mind that this is aiming for people that might not be on the same level of knowledge, so if you want to help me with some examples, please leave a little explanation. :)

Hope that this in the future becomes useful for everyone!
