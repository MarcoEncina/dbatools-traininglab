# Readme

Edited by `DanielSSilva`

Do you want to know more about `dbatools` but you don't have examples or samples to test it safely? 
Are you like me, curious about the power of both tools? Then you came to the right repository!

### Objectives of this repo:
 * Quickly get samples and examples to test one or many commands
 * Some explanation of how/why it's like it is
 * Explanations for the "beginners"
 * Gather information about best practices

# As always, any contribution is welcome! 

Please keep in mind that this is aiming for people that might not be on the same level of knowledge, so if you want to help with some examples, please leave a little explanation. :)

Hope that this in the future becomes useful for everyone!
